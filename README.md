# legendary-toolbox
Relatively "niche" tools that are useful in day-to-day life, especially when working closely with numbers and other math-adjacent projects.

## decimal-to-fraction
Sometimes numbers are given only in terms of decimals, which is annoying when you actually need the fraction. Of course, any decimal $d$ can be written as a fraction $\frac{x}{10^m},$ but this is generally not what is being looked for. This useful and incredibly simple tool generates instances of fully reduced fractions that would round to your inputted decimal; for instance, $ratl(0.43, 1)$ will return $3/7$ since $3/7 = 0.42857...$
